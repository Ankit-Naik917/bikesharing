# Bikesharing
## Background
Kate and her friend a trip to New York city and used Citibike to roam around the city and interacted with people. They had an idea to start the same type of business in Des Moines. They found an angel investor who is willing to invest in the business. To develop the proposal and get the investor on board, the request was made to do some analysis on the bikesharing data to provide better understanding to Kate and her friend.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to utilize the bikesharing data csv file in Tableau for analysis. The analysis will be done so that it creates a baseline for developing a proposal for opening a similar business in Des Moines. Using tableau multiple scenarios will be displayed which will provide better understanding and visuals to the users.

## Summary
Visualization using bike trip data shows the peak hours when the availability of the bike is must. As a result the maintenance of the bike should be performed during 12AM-4AM. The top starting location information is available to determine the priority of locations for bike maintenance. Most of the trips were completed between 6AM-10AM and 5PM-7PM and these are commute times for employees.  Probability of using bikes to get to work location to avoid the traffic is high.
